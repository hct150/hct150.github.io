      Hello! My name is HC, and I am a sophomore at Columbia Engineering. I spend
      most of my time studying applied mathematics, but I’ve also been enjoying
      my classes in economics, CS, physics, history…<br><br>

      This blog is me trying to remind myself that I do actually love math (yes,
      I know, very nerdy). I've been feeling that the only math I'm supposed to
      care about is the career-relevant kind, and while I do like the serious
      stuff, I'm also just a person.<br><br>
