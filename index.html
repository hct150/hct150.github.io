    Hello! My name is HC, and I am a sophomore at Columbia Engineering. I spend most of my time studying applied mathematics. But I’ve also been enjoying classes in economics, CS, physics, history…<br><br>

    This blog is my attempt to remind myself that I do actually love math (yes, I know, very nerdy). I've been feeling boxed in and that the only math I'm supposed to care about is the career-relevant kind. And while I do love the serious stuff, I'm also just a person.<br><br>

    I have no rigid timeline or material goals for this. It's really going to be about anything, so long as it’s amusing to me and harmless to others.<br>
</p>
